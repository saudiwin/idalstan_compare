# model will pick up on time-varying shocks that the random walk model ignores

# Having compared models, let's use the random walk model and

# considerable trouble identifying this model because of the low number of groups (i.e., 3 parties)
# to identify it I added a default option for random-walk models that also constrains the 
# over-time mean of one of the parties (Democrats), not just fixing an initial value
# even so, the variance has to be restricted to .1
# note how close this is to the variational inference (very, very close)
